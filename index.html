Just shoot at a wall a couple of times and it’ll be blatantly obvious. But in a real gameplay scenario, we’re no longer in a vacuum. Aim Assist will help you hit shots even if your weapon is bouncing around randomly. As long as the number ends in a 5, it’ll still average out to be vertical so you’ll pretty much just have to pull straight down to counteract the recoil with some minor micro-adjustments.</p><p id="0f4fae5d-970d-4d52-a5e3-e74ee801b70e" class="">But of course, AA cannot make up for everything completely. With low RD values, you’ll still encounter WILD kicks to either side which, when combined with flinch, will make controlling your weapon extremely hard. This is why I would recommend getting it as close to 100 as possible with “ending in 5” being a secondary priority. At least on burst and full-auto weapons that is. Single-shot weapons usually don’t need RD as much to perform. </p><figure id="760cc668-3ae1-4e68-a128-fda292b25335" class="image"><a href="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/Untitled.png"><img style="width:1912px" src="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/Untitled.png"/></a><figcaption>This Recoil Direction graph illustrates the amount of randomness (width of the squiggly thingy™) at each RD stat point alongside the direction the weapon tends to kick in.

For example in the case of a 14 zoom Hand Cannon, it would be <mark class="highlight-gray_background">14 / 10 = 1.4x</mark>. This magnification value is what’s used for all the other things Zoom messes with like damage and AA falloff.</p><h3 id="5f0c8807-4270-4e59-91d5-493da81da77c" class="">Zoom - Magnification: Fusion Rifles</h3><p id="ad897015-e951-4c8c-9e1b-82cfa91b9dc2" class="">Fusions are another <del>pile of flaming garbage</del> small issue when it comes to magnification.

Let me explain.</p><p id="bb40cd3c-1615-4d9c-a7fb-bdaf9f19fc5b" class="">Let’s say you’re ADS with a 1x zoom (not a thing in the game but it would be the ADS equivalent of hip-firing) and start firing at a wall 20 meters away. Let’s assume ideal conditions and that we have perfectly vertical recoil with the same distance between each shot for the sake of this explanation. So from that, we got a line of bullet holes that’s, say, 2 meters long.</p><p id="15349fb1-ad40-413f-bed9-9b6e085d8442" class="">Now let’s turn the zoom up to 2x. This means that from the player’s point of view, the wall is 2x larger compared to the 1x zoom (hip-fire) size. You unload another clip of bullets next to the previous line and notice that it’s pretty much exactly half the size.</p><p id="8c8f2339-d5c3-47cb-9cb8-0e6da1aa0c37" class="">So how do I explain this? Simple. I already mentioned how the wall appears to be double the size with a 2x zoom, right? So as you fire your weapon, it recoils say 10 pixels up from where you were aimed regardless of your zoom. But while with 1x zoom, those 10 pixels directly translate to some distance on the wall, in the 2x zoom case, it’s like you’re half the distance away from the wall so the bullet holes will be half the distance from each other as well.</p><p id="4b4e31c3-3bf7-415d-b4da-aeacaf7d2a1a" class="">Here are some images to help illustrate what I’m trying to convey:</p><figure id="2501ec90-abcf-4181-ab19-13dce51a2fe6" class="image"><a href="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/Same_Height.png"><img style="width:1920px" src="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/Same_Height.png"/></a></figure><figure id="c0472d44-1f03-46b9-bba5-51ee21600759" class="image"><a href="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/ADS_Tighter.png"><img style="width:1920px" src="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/ADS_Tighter.png"/></a></figure><h3 id="7ddb91e4-060a-4f43-90c1-d9fa888820e2" class="">Zoom - Damage Falloff</h3><p id="d4e860da-aa69-4695-82ae-c896082e7499" class="">Next up is damage falloff. And while this one is a large can of worms that I’ll open up a bit more in the next section, it’s basically tied to the magnification you get from Zoom.</p><p id="750e2a44-f1f1-4d44-9e44-5862e7c07009" class="">In simple terms, the damage falloff start and endpoints seem to be pushed out by the magnification value. So if you have a 1.5x magnification on a weapon the starting and endpoint of damage falloff would be pushed out by 1.5x — a 50% increase.</p><p id="d4c3f756-b1b2-4166-a357-a947dfd05cf6" class="">The starting point of damage falloff is what we’re all very familiar with at this point. It’s where your damage starts to dip below the normal values without damage falloff. Most sites that display weapon range refer to the damage falloff starting point.</p><p id="4658b990-a54c-48fb-8c61-c9d370e63231" class="">The endpoint of damage falloff, on the other hand, is where your damage bottoms out and doesn’t decrease anymore. Past this point, no matter how far you are from the target, you’ll still deal the same amount of damage so long as your shot lands.</p><p id="7a717d55-cef5-4cf2-bd63-60166235fcc8" class="">Damage scales down linearly between these two points — which is also what I take advantage of in my range testing methodology that I cover in the next section.</p><h3 id="01d0942c-e0ad-4c46-b446-4bf0e1a059a0" class="">Zoom - Aim Assist Falloff</h3><p id="9d53b8e3-8d43-4782-9aa0-b668016a860b" class="">Aim assist falloff is a pretty complicated thing to explain and I’ll go over that later but as a simple rundown, beyond the distance where AA falloff kicks in (AA falloff start), your AA cones will start to degrade (including the bullet bend, precision, and reticle friction cones) in size and “pie-slice behavior” will be turned on. This continues to the point where you no longer receive any help from Aim Assist. This happens when the distance is outside of the AA falloff endpoint.</p><p id="d771a181-6e7a-4b56-9bc9-03cf9b359539" class="">We can’t really test where AA falloff ends for pretty obvious reasons but “pie-slice behavior” is a great way to reliably test where AA falloff starts in ADS.</p><p id="736e8071-09cf-46df-9dc2-b88d4e190664" class="">We also have reason to believe the AA falloff (start and end) is scaled in the same way as the damage falloff and is directly tied to the magnification level.</p><p id="f281fff9-1472-44ac-9f2e-47ea9c8cf4b9" class="">The reason we can infer this is that before its nerf in November 2022, Rangefinder was measured to provide a roughly 30% increase in AA falloff. This was later stated to be only a 20% increase by Bungie and because we know it provides a 10% increase to the <em><strong><span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid">magnification</span></strong></em> (no, not to the Zoom Stat), we can multiply the two bonuses together (20% x 10%) and we get a 32% increase from that which is in the margin of a measurement error from the previously measured 30%. So we can conclude that a 10% increase in magnification will also bring with it a 10% increase in AA falloff.</p><h3 id="3e0845e0-1160-4d1e-8b7f-4bbad421c1fc" class="">Zoom - Base Cone Sizes</h3><p id="c0d59186-d770-48f6-961a-fa05f51ef8b4" class="">I’m going to start this section off with something that you probably didn’t even notice: the reason I specified “<strong><span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid">Base</span></strong> Cone Sizes” as opposed to just “Cone Sizes”. The reason is simple. Zoom will not have ANY effect on accuracy bloom or any other penalty that’s applied to the cones for whatever reason (like airborne penalties). Those come into play at a later layer and entirely bypass Zoom.</p><p id="e2a11c7b-4f26-44d5-a94e-ea4814bff95e" class="">But let’s get to the actual topic at hand. The main character of the story here is once again Magnification. And everything is really simple here as Bungie has already told us the way this works in a TWAB:</p><blockquote id="75e6cd68-638c-4ed9-97d5-d81a81d316f8" class=""><em><strong>Is there a way to estimate how much zoom decreases the effective cone angles?</strong></em><p id="36d96b7d-74ff-45c1-aa5f-1150fd7a0ec2" class=""><em>On most weapons, you can just divide the base cone angle by the zoom: i.e., 3 degrees base / 1.5x zoom = 2 degrees. Zoom reduces the size of both aim assist and accuracy cones, which means you are more accurate at higher zooms but have a smaller aim assist radius. That being said, some weapons have additional scaling applied on top, like Sniper Rifles with aim assist.</em></p></blockquote><p id="307a6813-f63e-48e3-a08f-33a8330186f2" class="">So there’s that, my job here is done. Divide the cone angle by the magnification and there’s that, right? Not quite. We still need to mention a couple of things here to stay accurate.</p><p id="2d786374-fa37-41f1-a1a0-3ac6e5bdc062" class="">The first thing to note is that in the case of accuracy, the base cone angles in hip-fire and ADS are different and this is calculated even before zoom comes into play. So please don&#x27;t mix the two up under any circumstances. With Snipers, the mistake would be extremely obvious because there are multiple orders of magnitude of a difference between the base ADS and hip-fire accuracy cone angles but things won’t be so evident on other weapons.</p><p id="364ff74d-d079-4e22-89cf-6e6452123251" class="">The second thing is something even the TWAB mentioned: Sniper AA scaling. And to be completely transparent with you about things, this is a topic I haven’t bothered much with so I can’t speak on it much. The only thing I can say is that 50 zoom will have “normal AA”, anything below that will have a small penalty, and anything above it will have some added forgiveness.</p><p id="7b293b8f-ad24-4b1e-98a8-9c742545507a" class="">Geolocating Shark has also made a Desmos tool to estimate the benefits you gain from this scaling which you can find <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/keahw1dfxf">here</a>. I cannot verify its accuracy but I’m sure you can ask all about it in the <a href="https://discord.gg/TheyfeQ">Destiny Massive Breakdown Discord</a>’s <span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid"><strong>#destiny-science</strong></span> channel.</p><h3 id="7431e573-aeed-406e-a707-044d7135bf73" class="">Last Minute Notes - Magnification</h3><p id="c63db626-1557-4f4a-a038-89d2e1a05877" class="">As I was finishing up this document and working on some illustrations, I stumbled upon what can be best described as a “fucking piece of shit, fuck my life” moment - to directly quote myself from a couple of weeks ago.</p><p id="46ef8a1c-b95a-401a-8b9b-2ebd7866f105" class="">So here’s the rundown because I’m way too burnt out on this topic after having worked on it for close to 9 months at this point to extensively test it myself: the actual magnification while ADS doesn’t seem to line up with the falloff multipliers as well as we had thought/hoped. The physical magnification always seems to be a certain amount higher compared to the multipliers mentioned.</p><p id="12b00197-84c0-4514-9368-55141378cbbc" class="">Ultimately, this doesn’t have too much of an effect on things so I will not spend months rewriting this whole section and running tests but it will influence two parts of it: the cone angles and recoil.</p><p id="4257aa60-3cee-4e83-9c5c-e44c9e7d0aad" class="">As mentioned in the previous section, the cone angles get scaled down by the magnification value. The magnification value referenced here is the physical magnification (i.e. how much you actually zoom in when ADS). Since the physical magnification seems to be higher than what the zoom stat itself would indicate, your cones will be narrowed down a bit further with that as well.</p><p id="7873ef8b-1f60-48e4-acaf-a7a88b56970a" class="">In the case of Accuracy, this is obviously good news because less randomness is always a good thing but the same can’t be said for the Aim Assist cones. Similarly to Accuracy, this is also good news in regard to weapon recoil. Less weapon kick to deal with is always welcome.</p><h3 id="3e6e9dd9-bad2-4247-8342-08a1ee5304d0" class="">Zoom’s Ingenuity - Game Feel</h3><p id="8bc84874-cd94-40d9-b0e8-70dc32337900" class="">But now, let’s get into a bit more of the “feel” territory that’s not just about numbers. I want to talk about why I think this is how things interact with Zoom. This will be pure speculation so feel free to skip ahead but I think it’s an interesting topic and I’m relatively confident in the accuracy of my inferences in this section.</p><p id="7c2abfe0-1639-498b-bbcd-2da8410ea7da" class="">First off, your effective weapon range being pushed out by the same amount you’re zoomed in has a few benefits to your normal gameplay. The main thing this behavior accomplishes is that no matter what if a guardian looks to be the same distance away from you, you can pretty much expect your gun to perform mostly the same. Same damage, the same amount of AA, all that.</p><p id="2fc2f307-f535-48f8-83d3-80e50873fe6a" class="">And to illustrate what I mean by a guardian “appearing to be the same distance away”, let’s use a hypothetical situation where you keep your hip-fire FOV but all the mechanics behave like you’re ADS - basically 1x magnification (aka no magnification at all). In this situation, an enemy guardian will appear to be a certain size from your point of view.</p><p id="ece7d467-bbf1-4bfc-bd38-66cd9369b00d" class="">If you then increase the magnification to let’s say 2x, then the enemy from the same distance away will appear to be twice as close compared to the 1x magnification and thus also appear to be twice the size. Now, if you back up and double the distance between you and the enemy, they will appear to be the same size that they were with 1x magnification from half the distance away.</p><p id="fcb61c6e-fa4a-45c9-9b56-a8167418060a" class="">And in this situation, your damage, cones, and pretty much everything will behave in much the same way as if you were in the 1x magnification situation but you’re twice as far away. I have a pretty strong feeling that this is one of the biggest reasons - apart from extremely generous AA - that gunplay in this game feels so satisfying. Because regardless of your zoom level, you can pretty much expect your gun to behave in the same exact way every time against an enemy that <em>appears</em> to be a certain distance away in your sights.</p><p id="fefb65d7-a7d5-409b-a962-7db55d4ed765" class="">Of course, there are some discrepancies with Sniper AA having additional scaling based on Zoom but the “feel” of sniper zoom is a whole other rabbit hole I don’t want to jump into right now.</p><p id="fbf8acba-e733-4141-9ef5-4fa8e62dc3e3" class="">I think this is some really clever game design and it’s frankly fascinating how much thought went into these mechanics. </p><hr id="a043eafd-1f0b-435a-963c-870cb6257522"/><h1 id="4c3a82f1-7590-4a10-8da2-3b9f15c857f9" class="">Precise Damage Falloff Testing</h1><p id="c2243708-434c-4131-804c-140e1cbd1321" class="">Alright, I did say that I’d tell you guys how to test damage falloff and zoom so let’s get into it. I’ll have a lot of pictures here to help illustrate the process to make things easier <em>and to avoid generating inconsistent testing methodologies</em>. First and foremost, you’ll need a pike. Pretty much any pike will do but there are some differences between them that we can make use of.</p><p id="0b832c11-df71-4be3-b574-46d68e70cd2e" class="">The main places where you can find pikes are in the opening encounter of the Deep Stone Crypt raid and in the Winding Cove on the EDZ. These are the ones I recommend using for tests. The main difference between the two of them is that with the DSC pikes, your damage falloff endpoint will be ignored and damage will continue to drop even beyond it. This will be helpful for weapons with really aggressive damage falloff like Fusion Rifles.</p><p id="cf4c48ff-bdba-430f-b150-e1bf4c824c76" class="">The EDZ pikes on the other hand don’t exhibit this odd behavior so you can use them to measure what percentage of your normal damage your minimum damage will be (aka the damage beyond the damage falloff endpoint). Although, that is unnecessary as we already know that for each weapon archetype. Most weapons other than Hand Cannons will bottom out at half the normal damage while Hand Cannons will bottom out at 1/3. Shotguns as a whole are the other group that behaves differently as they bottom out at 0 damage.<div class="indented"><p id="b4eac8fa-53df-4ecb-a7a3-8bed6ff2d607" class="">So if your weapon does 600 damage from up close, it will deal 300 damage beyond the damage falloff endpoint on most weapons or 200 damage if it’s a Hand Cannon. And in the case of Shotguns (Slug and Pellet), the last number you’ll see is 1 (or some slightly scaled-up version of it) before your shots no longer register as hits. <em>(Though it&#x27;s worth noting that your shotgun shots will despawn regardless of damage damage falloff at 25m)</em></p></div></p><p id="9c7ce24d-b62e-43dd-9568-06e5ce69bf8b" class="">So with the differences noted, let’s go over which one I recommend for testing. Generally, I recommend the EDZ pikes for most situations as it’s a more convenient place to test, and new batches of pike riding fallen spawn in pretty regularly so you’ll have enough of them to shoot for a long time. Additionally, you also have a lot more free space in the winding cove to test without having to worry about the Frostbite debuff in DSC.</p><p id="10334c90-cc1c-45a4-b811-1185f4b1d520" class="">I recommend DSC for close-range weapons and for testing hip-fire damage falloff on mid-range weapons. The main ones I would recommend testing here would be Fusion Rifles and Shotguns (but mainly just fusions, EDZ is generally better for most tests IMO).</p><p id="608c8a84-7491-442b-a022-ac72ed8936e2" class="">And 7 paragraphs in, it’s finally time to talk about the methodology. First off, you’ll notice there’s a distance marker above the pikes that tells you how far you are from the <span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid"><em><strong>center</strong></em></span> of the pike. This waypoint system is half the reason why using pikes will be important. The other reason is that pikes show us larger damage numbers that let us get more precision out of our damage measurements.<div class="indented"><p id="91632394-7cd5-49ac-8c65-1a94607be18e" class="">A mostly unimportant detail to note here is that the waypoint system calculates the distance between the center of the pike and your <em>camera</em>. This doesn’t really change anything but I thought it might be an interesting little something to throw in here since everyone is probably tired from reading this dissertation.</p></div></p><p id="b357653b-cc2d-44cc-be85-be14c6a5d63b" class="">So here is the entire methodology step-by-step:</p><ol type="1" id="6353d270-0dbb-4e55-9807-a3e15ab6db96" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Make a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ispe9k3IqAsx5IwvnN1sMFXi6M9AHN6ikRLA0ol4CuU/">This Spreadsheet</a>, which we’ll be using to keep track of our tests.<mark class="highlight-red">

How the trajectory of the bullet is determined is a two-step process. First, the game picks a random point inside the circle <em>(remember, this circle is the intersection of the cone and the screen)</em> and then draws a line from the vertex of the cone <em>(aka your in-game camera position)</em> through that random point all the way to infinity. Well, not quite to infinity but pretty damn far at the very least.</p><p id="bd7318e9-3e17-4987-997a-78bb6772404c" class="">Here’s a 3D illustration to help explain the process:</p><div id="354e83d1-925e-4e65-9880-0b29e0d2ee55" class="column-list"><div id="13f3e739-89eb-4608-80d5-9778c3cbb271" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="ce57cdff-6829-4821-bec4-7bacc50bfa1a" class="image"><a href="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/Untitled%207.png"><img style="width:386px" src="Farewell%20-%20A%20Parting%20Gift%20b60896db427b45c49012b73ec6996dee/Untitled%207.png"/></a></figure></div><div id="0223a550-95a3-4e92-a995-65447f3d4de4" style="width:112.5%" class="column"><p id="cf3e1df3-41da-46c1-98b2-7c2986c1427b" class="">

<em>This mechanic is standard practice in game development and makes for a more intuitive and comfortable shooting experience.</em></li></ol><ol type="1" id="dc1fdeca-346d-4cbd-9b90-c3b42c2da52e" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Since the first point is true, it means that the bullet trails your see are actually a lie, as they come out of the barrel of your gun instead of out of your camera. In practice, your bullet is actually an invisible “projectile” <em>(using quotation marks as this is referring to hitscan weapons)</em> and the bullet trails are simply drawn from your barrel to the place where your shot “lands”.
<em>Once again this is also standard practice with game development to improve the immersion and realism aspects of it at the cost of sometimes exhibiting physically impossible behavior that players generally don’t notice without explicitly looking for them. Examples of this include bullet trails going through walls among other things.</em></li></ol><p id="9e70cc2f-964b-4f29-9372-98725441fe55" class="">
</p><p id="21023e4f-263f-4edc-9907-ce1bf06a09db" class="">And as a final note here: why calling it the Error Angle is actually significantly better terminology.</p><ol type="1" id="723f1c19-c73d-4634-ba46-3b702ac0d192" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Since this ‘cone’ is infinite, it’s practically just an angle with walls. (I swear my math teacher would hang me if I said this in front of him) Additionally, the cone isn’t actually simulated by the game. Instead, there’s simply a circle and a point. (Although they may have an internal debug feature to simulate the cone itself and display it.)</li></ol><ol type="1" id="251b5c0c-faac-4a37-a7b1-614bddd58160" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>What this angle determines is the randomness - hence error - when firing your weapon. It’s simply more intuitive to understand what a “Smaller Error Angle” is compared to saying “Narrower Accuracy Cone”. The first option immediately gives the reader more context for the benefit provided. Everyone can intuitively understand that less error is better compared to the extra thinking required to process what an “Accuracy Cone” even is. Not that you, the reader, would have any issue with that at this point.</li></ol><h3 id="b77c6fdf-5c70-4a0e-8cc0-c632e27bc0c4" class="">Accuracy Bloom / Cone Growth</h3><h2 id="2c48ff18-dfe1-4415-a24d-9f7c4f774251" class="">Aim Assist Cones</h2><h3 id="608940f2-81c5-432d-8e33-c85a525d8936" class="">Auto Aim / Bullet Bending</h3><h3 id="f388669b-6a95-435a-b95a-6fde9e26a5f6" class="">Precision Aim Cone</h3><h3 id="0e48a2da-2d08-4b07-95cb-132ad92c6063" class="">“Pie Slice” Behavior</h3><h3 id="28136eb2-aa83-4429-a280-b87c5c8fcea2" class="">Reticle Friction / Adhesion</h3><h2 id="44cda478-931f-4c98-bc93-480204d1e404" class="">Airborne Effectiveness</h2><h1 id="a06e6d1d-f585-4489-9797-3f3698173113" class="">Additional Notes</h1><h3 id="1479d81f-bf8a-49eb-a7a2-dced5123b286" class="">Slide Penalty</h3><h3 id="0f305f94-1d42-4b25-a443-2b8282389c46" class="">Flinch Resistance Scaling (Resil, Perks, Mods)</h3><h3 id="51f80ddf-9723-48f3-b5f7-d5745a0d87d7" class="">Lesser-known resources</h3><h1 id="ba45c53e-98a7-4f77-8fe3-07a12da94121" class="">Farewell</h1><p id="ae8cd243-43b1-462f-af8d-2a1fa09c0de9" class="">
